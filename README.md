## About
Learn Duel is based on QuizDuel and works in a similar fashion, but with a new twist:
You play with questions based on your school or study assignments.

## Current features
For now, there is only local play, but online features will be added later.
If you are playing alone, the answers can be selected with the mouse or the keys 1-4.
In local multiplayer mode player 1 can specify his answer with the keys 1-4 and
player 2 with the keys 6-9.


## Future features:
 - define your own questions
 - play with up to 3 friends online and compete against each other
